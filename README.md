### How to use (Example)
Let's say you want to use book icon instead of the Twitter icon  

The line under your wanted link contains this line: "fab fa-twitter"  

Then, after founding the icon that you want and its code, 
paste the code in the same place where was your previous one  

The final code shoud look like this: "fa-solid fa-book"
