## Social Media Icons
Here you can choose your wanted icons for each link:  
https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free  

### Before using:
* Make sure that you choose only from the "free" section.  
* Copy the code for HTML/CSS.  

### How to use (Example)
Let's say you want to use book icon instead of the Twitter icon  

The line under your wanted link contains this line: "fab fa-twitter"  

Then, after founding the icon that you want and its code, 
paste the code in the same place where was your previous one  

The final code shoud look like this: "fa-solid fa-book"  

## How to customize the template (which lines you should change)

### index.html file
1. line 7 - website title  
2. line 10 - website icon image  
3. line 15 - profile image  
4. line 20 - user name  
5. line 24 - description  
6. lines 28-52 - your social media links  

### style.css file
1. line 1 - font (importing it from google fonts)  
2. line 4 - text color  
3. line 5 - font 
4. line 21 - your backround image  

## Backround image 
You can change backround to color instead of using an image.  

### Backround Color
background-color: #7E65F5;
